		<li>Rules, properties and values</li>
	</ul>
	<p>In this section, we will look at how to make your web pages more attractive, controlling the design of them using CSS></p>
	<p>CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear.</p>
	<p>FOr example, you can specify that the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should appear in gray using the Arial typeface or that all level one headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.</p>
	<p>Once you have learned how to write a CSS rule, learning CSS mostly involves learning the different properties you can use. SO this chapter will: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Introduce you to how CSS works</li>
		<li>Teach you how to write CSS rules</li>
		<li>Show you how CSS rules apply to HTML pages</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<p>The key to understanding how CSS works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element.</p>
	<h4><b>BLOCK AND INLINE ELEMENTS</b></h4>
	<p>Block level elements look like they start on a new line. Examples include: <b>h1, h6, p, div elements</b>.</p>
	<p>Inline elements flow within the text and do not start on a new line. Examples include: <strong>b, i, img, em, span</strong>.</p>
	<h3>CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented.</h3>
	<p>The <strong>body</strong> element creates the first box, then the <strong>h1, h2, p, i, a</strong> elements each create their own boxes within it.</p>
	<p>Using CSS you could add a border around any of the boxes, specify its width and height, or add a background colour. You could also control text inside a box - for example, its colour, size and the typeface used.</p>
	<h4>Example Styles</h4>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>BOXES: </strong></li>
		<p>Width and Height</p>
		<p>Borders (Colour, Width and Style)</p>
		<p>Background Colour and Images</p>
		<p>Position in the Browser Window</p>
		<li><strong>TEXT: </strong></li>
		<p>Typeface</p>
		<p>Size</p>
		<p>Colour</p>
		<p>Italics, bold, uppercase, lowercase, small-caps</p>
		<li><strong>SPECIFIC: </strong></li>
		<p>There are also specific ways in which you can style certain elements such as lists, tables and forms.</p>
	</ul>
	<h3>CSS ASSOCIATES STYLE RULES WITH HTML ELEMENTS</h3>
	<p>CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>selector</strong></li>
		<li><strong>declaration</strong></li>
	</ul>
	p { -> Selector
	<br>
		font-family: Arial; -> Declaration
	}
	<p>This rule indicates that all <strong>p</strong> elements should be shown in the Arial typeface.</p>
	<p><strong>Selectors</strong> indicate which element the rule applies to. The same rule can apply to more than one element if you separate the element names with commas.</p>
	<p><strong>Declarations</strong> indicates how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled. Declarations are split into two parts (a property and a value), and are separated by a colon.</p>
	<br>
	<h3>CSS PROPERTIES AFFECT HOW ELEMENTS ARE DISPLAYED</h3>
	<p>CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: </p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>PROPERTY</strong></li>
		<li><strong>VALUE</strong></li>
	</ul>
	<p>And separated by a colon.</p>
	<p>You can specify several properties in one declaration, each separted by a semi-colon.</p>
	h1, h2, h3 {
	<br>
		font-family: Arial;
	<br>
		<em>Property</em><- color: yellow; -><em>Value</em>
	<br>
	}
	<br>
	<p>This rule indicates that all <strong>h1, h2, h3</strong> elements should be shown in the Arial typeface, in a yellow colour.</p>
	<p><strong>Properties</strong> indicate the aspects of the element you want to change. For example, colour, font, width, height and border.</p>
	<p><strong>Values</strong> specify the settings you want to use for the chosen properties. For example, if you want to specify a colour property then the value is the colour you want the text in these elements to be.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Here you can see a simple web page that is style using CSS.</p>
	<p>This example uses two documents: The HTML file (example.html) and a separate CSS file (example.css). The fifth line of HTML uses the <strong>link</strong> element to indicate where the CSS file is located.</p>
	<p>On the next page, you will see how CSS rules can also be placed in your HTML pages and we will discuss when you might want to do this.</p>
	<h4>Example:</h4>
		<em>(load 9b.Example_Intro_CSS index.html)</em>
	<br>
	<h3>Using External CSS</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>LINK: </strong></li>
		<p>The <b>link</b> element can be used in an HTML document to tell the browser where to find the CSS file used to style the page.</p>
		<p>It is an empty element (meaning it does not needa closing tag), and it lives inside the <strong>head</strong> element. It should use three attributes.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>HREF: </strong></li>
			<p>This specifies the path to the CSS file (which is often placed in a folder called <strong>css</strong> or <strong>styles</strong>.</p>
			<li><strong>TYPE: </strong></li>
			<p>This attribute specifies the type of document being linked to. The value should be <strong>text/css</strong>.</p>
			<li><strong>REL: </strong></li>
			<p>This specifies the relationship between the HTML page and the file it is linked to. The value should be <strong>stylesheet</strong> when linking to a CSS file.</p>
			<p>An HTML page can use more than one CSS stylesheet. To do this it could have a <strong>link</strong> element for every CSS file it uses. For example, some authors use one CSS file to control the presentation (such as fonts and colours) and a second to control the layout.</p>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<h4>Example:</h4>
		<em>(load 9c.Example_External_CSS index.html)</em>
	<br>
	<h3>Using Internal CSS</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>STYLE: </strong></li>
		<p>You can also include CSS rules within an HTML page by placing them inside a <strong>style</strong> element, which usually sits inside the <strong>head</strong> element of the page.</p>
		<p>The <strong>style</strong> element should use the <b>type</b> attribute to indicate that the styles are specified in CSS. The Value should be <b>text/css</b>.</p>
		<p>When building a site with more than one page, you should use an external CSS Stylesheet. This:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Allows all pages to use the same style rules (rather than repeating them in each page.)</li>
			<li>Keeps the content separate from how the page looks.</li>
			<li>Means you can chcange the styles used across all pages by altering just one file (rather than each individual page).</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<p>In HTML4 and Transitional XHTML, you could also use a <b>style</b> attribute on most of the elements that appear in the body of a page.</p>
	<p>The CSS rules that appeared within the value of the attribute would only apply to that one element. You should avoid using this attribute in any new site but I mention it here because you may see it used in older code. Here is an example that changes the colour of the text in a single paragraph to red: <em>p style="color:red;"</em></p>

	<br>
	<h3>CSS Selectors</h3>
	<p>These are many different types of CSS selector that allow you to target rules to specific elements in an HTML document.</p>
	<p>The table on the opposite page introduces the most commonly used CSS selectors.</p>
	<p>On this page, there is an HTML file to demonstrate which elements there CSS selectors would apply to.</p>
	<p>CSS selectors are case sensitive, so they must match element names and attribute values exactly.</p>
	<p>Thesre are some more advanced selectors which allow you to select elements based on attributes and their values.</p>
	<p>IE 7 was the first version of IE to support the last two selectors in the table (the sibling selectors), so their use is less common than the othe selectors shown here.</p>

		<h3>How CSS Rules Cascade</h3>
		<p>If there are two or more rules that apply to the same element, it is important to understand which will take precedence.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>LAST RULE: </strong></li>
			<p>If the two selectors are identical, the latter of the two will take precedence. Here you can see the second <em>i</em> selector takes precedence over the first.</p>
			<li><strong>SPECIFICITY: </strong></li>
			<p>If one selector is more specific than the others, the more specific rule will take precedence over more general nes. In this example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>h1</strong> is more specific than <strong>*</strong></li>
				<li><strong>p b</strong> is more specific than <strong>p</strong></li>
				<li><strong>p#intro</strong> is more specific than <strong>p</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<li><strong>IMPORTANT: </strong></li>
			<p>You can add <strong>!important</strong> after any property value to indicate that it should be considered more important than other rules that apply to the same element.</p>
			<p>Understanding how CSS rules cascade means you can write simpler style sheets because you can create generic rules that apply to most elements and then override the properties of individual elements that need to appear differently.</p>
		</ul>

		<h3>Inheritance</h3>
		<p>If you specify the <b>font-family</b> or <b>color</b> properties on the <b>body</b> element, they will apply to most child elements. This is because the value of the font-family property is inherited by child elements. It saves you from having to apply these properties to as many elements (and results in simpler style sheets).</p>
		<p>You can compare this with the <b>background-color</b> or <b>border</b> propertiesl they are <b>not inherited</b> by child elements. If these were inherited by all child elements. If these were inherited by all child elements then the page could look quite messy.</p>
		<p>You can force a lot of properties to inherit values from their parent elements by using <b>inherit</b> for the value of the properties.</p>
		<p>In this example, the <b>div</b> element with a class called page inherits the padding size from the CSS rule that applies to the <b>body</b> element.</p>
