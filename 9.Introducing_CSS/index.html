	</ul>
	<p>In this section, we will look at how to make your web pages more attractive, controlling the design of them using CSS></p>
	<p>CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear.</p>
	<p>FOr example, you can specify that the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should appear in gray using the Arial typeface or that all level one headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.</p>
	<p>Once you have learned how to write a CSS rule, learning CSS mostly involves learning the different properties you can use. SO this chapter will: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Introduce you to how CSS works</li>
		<li>Teach you how to write CSS rules</li>
		<li>Show you how CSS rules apply to HTML pages</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<p>The key to understanding how CSS works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element.</p>
	<h4><b>BLOCK AND INLINE ELEMENTS</b></h4>
	<p>Block level elements look like they start on a new line. Examples include: <b>h1, h6, p, div elements</b>.</p>
	<p>Inline elements flow within the text and do not start on a new line. Examples include: <strong>b, i, img, em, span</strong>.</p>
	<h3>CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented.</h3>
	<p>The <strong>body</strong> element creates the first box, then the <strong>h1, h2, p, i, a</strong> elements each create their own boxes within it.</p>
	<p>Using CSS you could add a border around any of the boxes, specify its width and height, or add a background colour. You could also control text inside a box - for example, its colour, size and the typeface used.</p>
	<h4>Example Styles</h4>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>BOXES: </strong></li>
		<p>Width and Height</p>
		<p>Borders (Colour, Width and Style)</p>
		<p>Background Colour and Images</p>
		<p>Position in the Browser Window</p>
		<li><strong>TEXT: </strong></li>
		<p>Typeface</p>
		<p>Size</p>
		<p>Colour</p>
		<p>Italics, bold, uppercase, lowercase, small-caps</p>
		<li><strong>SPECIFIC: </strong></li>
		<p>There are also specific ways in which you can style certain elements such as lists, tables and forms.</p>
	</ul>
