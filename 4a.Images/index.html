<h3>Adding Images and Height&Width of Images</h3>
<p>To add an image into the page you need an <b>img</b> element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes: </p>
<ul>
	<li><b>SRC</b></li>
	<p>This tells the browser where it can find the image file. </p>
	<p>This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your own site. (here you can see that the images are in a child folder called <b>images</b>.</p>
	<li><b>ALT</b></li>
	<p>This provides a text desciption of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.</p>
	<li><b>TITLE</b></li>
	<p>You can also use the title attribute with the (img) element to provide additional informaton about the image. Most browsers will display the content of this attribure in a tooltip when the user hovers over the image.</p>
	<p>The text used in the (alt) attribute is often referred to as <b>alt text</b>. It should give an accurate desciption of the image content so it can be understood by screen reader software (used by people with visual impairments) and search engines.</p>
	<p>If the image is just to make a page look more attractive (and it has no meaning, such as a graphic dividing line), then the (alt) attribute should still be used but the quotes should be left empty.</p>
	<li><b>HEIGHT</b></li>
	<p>This specifies the height of the image in pixels.</p>
	<li><b>WIDTH</b></li>
	<p>This specifies the width of the image in pixels.</p>
	<p>Images often take longer to load than the HTML code that makes up the rest of the page. It is, therefore, a good idea to specify the size of the image so that the browser can render the rest of the text on the page while leaving the right amount of space for the image that is still loading.</p>
	<h4>Example</h4>
	<img src="images/cat.jpg" alt="A cat" title="This cat is very cute" height="200" width="200">
</ul>

<br>

<h3>Where To Place Images In Your Code</h3>
<p>Where an image is placed in the code will affect how it is displayed.</p>
<p>Here are three examples of image placement that produce different results:</p>
<ol>
	<li><b>BEFORE A PARAGRAPH</b></li>
	<p>The paragraph starts on a new line after the image</p>
	<li><b>INSIDE THE START OF A PARAGRAPH</b></li>
	<p>The first row of the text aligns with the bottom of the image</p>
	<li><b>IN THE MIDDLE OF A PARAGRAPH</b></li>
	<p>The image is placed between the words of the paragraph that it appears in</p>
</ol>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<img src="images/bird.jpg" alt="Bird" width="250" height="200">
<p>There are around 10,000 living species of birds that inhabit different ecosystems from the Actic to the Antarctic. Many species undertake long distance annual migrations, and many more perform shorter irregular journeys.</p>
