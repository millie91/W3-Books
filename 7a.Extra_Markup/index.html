	<h3>Doctypes</h3>
	<p>Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using (although browsers usually display the page even if it is not included).</p>
	<p>We will be including one in each example for the rest of the book.</p>
	<p>As you will see when we come to look at CSS and its box model, the use of a DOCTYPE can also help the browser to render a page correctly.</p>
	<p>Because XHTML was written in XML, you will sometimes see pages that use the XHTML strict DOCTYPE start with the optional XML declaration.</p>
	<p>Where this is used, it should be the first thing in a document. There must be nothing before it, not even a space.</p>
	<br />
	<h3>Comments in HTML</h3>
	<p>If you want to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser, you can add the text between these characters: 
	<!-- comment goes here --></p>
	<p>It is a good idea to add comments to your code because, no matter how familiar you are with the page at the time of writing it, when you come back to it later (or if someone else needs to look at the code), comments will make it much easier to understand.</p>
	<p>Although comments are not visible to users in the main browser window, they can be viewed by anyone who looks at the source code behind the page.</p>
	<p>On a long page, you will often see comments used to indicate where sections of the page start and end, or to contain notes that help explain the code.</p>
	<p>Comments can also be used around blocks of code to stop that code from being displayed in the browser. In the following example, the email link has been commented out.</p>

	<h4>Example:</h4>
	<!-- start of introduction -->
	<h1 align="center">Current Exhibitions</h1>
	<h2>Olafur Eliasson</h2>
	<!-- end of introduction -->
	<!-- start of main text -->
	<p>Olafur Eliasson was born in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1967 to Icelandic parents.</p>
	<p>He is known for sculptures and large-scale installation art employing elemental materials such as light, water, and air temperature to enhance the viewer's experience.</p>
