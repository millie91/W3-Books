<h1 align="center">Forms</h1>
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
  <li><b>FORM: </b></li>
  <p> Controls live inside a <b>form</b> element. This element should always carry the <b>action</b> attribute and will usually have a <b>method</b> and <b>id</b> attribute.</p>
  <ul>
  	<li><b>ACTION: </b></li>
  	<p>Every <b>form</b> element requires an <b>action</b> attribute. Its value is the URL for tha page on the server that will receive the infromation in the form when it is submitted.</p>
  	<li><b>METHOD: </b></li>
  	<p>Forms can be sent using one of two methods: <b>get</b> or <b>post</b></p>
  	<p>With the get <b>method</b>, the values from the form are added to the end of the URL specified in the <b>action</b> attribute.</p>
  	<p>The <b>get method</b> is ideal for: </p>
  	<ul>
  		<li>short forms (such as search boxes)</li>
  		<li>when you are just retrieving data from the web server (not sending information that should be added to or deleted from a database</li>
  	</ul>
  	<p>With the <b>post method</b> the values are sent in what are known as HTTP headers. As a rule of thumb you should use the <b>post method</b> if your form: </p>
  	<ul>
  		<li>allows users to upload a file</li>
  		<li>is very long</li>
  		<li>contains sensitive data (eg passwords)</li>
  		<li>adds infromation to, or deletes infromation from, a database</li>
  	</ul>
  	<p>If the <b>method</b> attribute is not used, the form data will be sent using <b>get method</b></p>
  	<li><b>ID: </b></li>
  	<p>The value of <b>(id)</b> is used to identify the form distinctly from other elements on the page (and is often used by scripts - such as those that check you have entered infromation into fields that require values)</p>
  	<li><b>SIZE: </b></li>
  	<p>The <b>size</b> attribute should not be used on new forms.</p>
  	<p>It was used in older forms to indicate the width of the text input (measured by the number of characters that would be seen).</p>
  	<p>For example, a value of 3 would create a box wide enough to display three characters (Although a user could eter more characters if they desired).</p>
  	<p>In any new forms you write CSS should be used to c ontrol the width of form elements.</p>
  	<p>The <b>size</b> attribute is only mentioned here because you may come across it when looking at older code.</p>
  </ul>

	<h4>Example: </h4>
	<form action="http://www.example.com/subscribe.php" method="get">
		<p>This is where the form controls will appear.</p>
	</form>
	<br>

	<h3>Text Input</h3>
  <ul>
  	<li><b>INPUT: </b></li>
  	<p>The <b>input</b> element is used to create several different form controls. The value of the <b>type</b> attribute determines what kind of input they will be creating.</p>
  	<li><b>TYPE="TEXT": </b></li>
  	<p>When the <b>type</b> attribute has a value of <b>text</b>, it creates a single-line text input</p>
  	<li><b>NAME: </b></li>
  	<p>When users enter information into a form, the server needs to know which form control each piece of data was entered into. (For example, in login form, the server needs to know what has been entered as the username and what has been given as the password).</p>
  	<p>Therefore, each form control requires a <b>name</b> attribute.</p>
  	<p>The value of this attribute identifies the form control and is sent along with the infromation they enter to the server.</p>
  	<li><b>MAXLENGTH: </b></li>
	<p>You can use the <b>maxlength</b> attribute to limit the number of characters a user may enter into the text field.</p>
	<p>Its value is the number of characters they may enter. For example, if you were asking for a year, the <b>maxlength</b> attribute could have a value of 4.</p>
  </ul>

  <h4>Example: </h4>
  <form action="http://www.example.com/login.php">
  	<p>Username:
  	<input type="text" name="username" size="15" maxlength="30" />
  	</p>
  </form>
  <br>

  <h3>Password Input</h3>
  <ul>
  	<li><b>TYPE="PASSWORD": </b></li>
  	<p>When the <b>type</b> attribute has a value of <b>password</b> it creates a text box that acts just like a single-line text input, except the characters are blocked out.</p>
  	<p>They are hidden in this way so that if someone is looking over the user's shoulder, they cannot see sensitive data such as passwords.</p>
  	<li><b>NAME: </b></li>
  	<p>The <b>name</b> attribute indicates the name of the password input, which is sent to the server with the password the user enters.</p>
  	<li><b>SIZE, MAXLENGTH: </b></li>
  	<p>It can also carry the <b>size</b> and <b>maxlength</b> attributes like the single-line text input.</p>
  	<p>Although the password is hidden on the screen, it does not mean that the data in password control is sent securely to the server. You should never use these for sending sensitive data such as credit card numbers.</p>
  	<p>For full security, the server needs to be set up to communicate with users' browsers using <b>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL</b>.</p>
  </ul>

  <h4>Example: </h4>
  <form action="http://www.example.com/login-php">
  	<p>Username:
  	<input type="text" name="username" size="15" maxlength="30" />
  	</p>
  	<p>Password:
  	<input type="password" name="passowrd" size="15" maxlength="30" />
  	</p>
  </form>

  <h3>Text Area</h3>
  <ul>
  	<li><b>TEXTAREA: </b></li>
  	<p>Is an element used to create multi-line text input.</p>
  	<p>Unlike other input elements this is not an empty element. It should therefore have an opening and closing tag.</p>
  	<p>Any text that appears between the opening <b>textarea</b> and closing <b>textarea</b> tags will appear in the text box when the page loads.</p>
  	<p>If the user does not delete any text between these tags, this message will get sent to the server along with whatever the user has typed. (Some sites use JavaScript to clear this information when the user clicks in the text area).</p>
  	<p>If you are creating a new form, you should use CSS to control the <b>width</b> and <b>height</b> of a <b>textarea</b>.</p>
  	<p>The <b>cols</b> attribute indicates how wide the text area should be (measured in numbers of characters). The rows attribute indicates how many rows the <b>text area</b> should take up vertically.</p>
  </ul>

  <h4>Example: </h4>
  <form action="http://www.example.com/comments.php">
  	<p>What did you think of this gig?</p>
  	<textarea name="comments" cols="20" rows="4">Enter your comments...</textarea>
  </form>

  <h3>Radio Button</h3>
  <ul>
  	<li><b>INPUT: </b></li>
  	<ul>
  		<li><b>TYPE="RADIO": </b></li>
  		<p>Radio buttons allow users to pick just one of a number of options.</p>
  		<li><b>NAME: </b></li>
  		<p>The <b>name</b> attribute is sent to the server with the value of the option the user selects.</p>
  		<p>When a question provides users with options for answers in the form of radio buttons, the value of the <b>name</b> attribute should be the same for all of the radio buttons used to answer that question.</p>
  		<li><b>VALUE: </b></li>
  		<p>The <b>value</b> attribute indicates the value that is sent to the server for the selected option.</p>
  		<p>The value of each of the buttons in a group should be different (so that the server knows which option the user has selected).</p>
  		<li><b>CHECKED: </b></li>
  		<p>The <b>checked</b> attribute can be used to indicate which value (if any) should be selected when the page loads.</p>
  		<p>The value of this attribute is <b>checked</b>. Only one radio button in a group should use this attribute.</p>
  		<p>Once a radio button has been selected it cannot be deselected. The user can only select a different option. If you are only allowing the user one option and want them to be able to deselect it (for example if they are indicating they agree to terms and conditions), you shoul use a checkbox instead.</p>
  	</ul>
  	<h4>Example: </h4>
  	<form action="http://www.example.com/profile.php">
  		<p>Please select your favourite genre: 
	  		<br />
	  		<input type="radio" name="genre" value="rock" checked="checked" />Rock
	  		<input type="radio" name="genre" value="pop" />Pop
	  		<input type="radio" name="genre" value="jazz" />Jazz
  		</p>
  	</form>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h3>Checkbox</h3>
  <ul>
  	<li><b>INPUT: </b></li>
  	<ul>
  		<li><b>TYPE="CHECKBOX": </b></li>
  		<p>Checkboxes allow users to select and deselect one or more options in answer to a question.</p>
  		<li><b>NAME: </b></li>
  		<p>The <b>name</b> attribute is sent to the server with the value of the option(s) the user selects. </p>
  		<p>When a question provides users with options for answers in the form of checkboxes, the value of the <b>name</b> attribute should be the same for all of the buttons that answer that question.</p>
  		<li><b>VALUE: </b></li>
  		<p>The <b>value</b> attribute indicates the value sent to the server if this checkbox is checked.</p>
  		<li><b>CHECKED: </b></li>
  		<p>The <b>checked</b> attribute indicates that this box should be checked when the page loads. If used, its value should be checked.</p>
  	</ul>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h3>Drop Down List Box</h3>
  <ul>
  	<li><b>SELECT:</b></li>
  	<p>A drop down list box, also known as a select box, allows users to select one option from a drop down list.</p>
  	<p>The <b>(select)</b> element is used to create a drop down list box. It contains two or more <b>(option)</b> elements.</p>
  	<ul>
  		<li><b>NAME: </b></li>
  		<p>The name attribute indicates the name of the form control being sent to the server, along with the value the user selected.</p>
  	</ul>
  	<li><b>OPTION: </b></li>
  	<p>The <b>(option)</b> element is used to specify the options that the user can select from. The words between opening <b>(option)</b> and closing <b>(option)</b> tags will be shown to the user in the drop down box.</p>
  	<ul>
	  	<li><b>VALUE: </b></li>
	  	<p>The <b>(option)</b> element uses the value attribute to indicate the value that is sent to the server along with the name of the control if this option is selected.</p>
	  	<li><b>SELECTED: </b></li>
	  	<p>The selected attribute can be used to indicate the option that should be selected when the page loads. The value of this attribute should be selected.</p>
	  	<p>If this attribute is not used, the first option will be shown when the page loads. If the user does not select an option, then the first item will be sent to the server as the value for this control.</p>
	</ul>	
	<p>The <b>function</b> of the drop down list box is similar to that of the radio buttons (in that only one option can be selected). There are two key factors in choosing which to use:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><p>If users need to see all options at a glance, radio buttons are better suited</p></li>
		<li><p>If there is a very long list of options (such as a list of countries), drop down list boxes work better</p></li>
	</ol>
	<h4>Example: </h4>
	<form action="http://www.example.com/profile.php">
		<p>What device do you listen to music on?</p>
		<select name="devices">
			<option value="ipod">iPod</option>
			<option value="radio">Radio</option>
			<option value="computer">Computer</option>
		</select>
	</form>
  </ul>
  <br>
	<h3>Multiple Select Box</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><b>SELECT: </b></li>
		<br>
		<ul>
		<li><b>SIZE: </b></li>
			<p>You can turn a drop down select box into a box that shows more than one option by adding the <b>size</b> attribute.</p>
			<p>Its value should be the number of options you want to show at once. In the example you can see that three of the four options are shown.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, the way that browsers have implemented this attribute is not perfect and it should be tested thoroughly if used (<em>in particular in Firefox and Safari on Mac</em>).</p>
			<li><b>MULTIPLE: </b></li>
			<p>You can allow users to select multiple options from this list by adding the <b>multiple</b> attribute with a value of multiple.</p>
			<p>It is a good idea to tell users if they can select more than one option at a time. It is also helpful to indicate that on a PC they should hold down the <b>control</b> key while selecting multiple options and on a Mac they should use the <b>command</b> key while selecting options.</p>
		</ul>
	</ul>
</ul>
