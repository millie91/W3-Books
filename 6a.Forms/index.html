<h1 align="center">Forms</h1>
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
  <li><b>FORM: </b></li>
  <p> Controls live inside a <b>form</b> element. This element should always carry the <b>action</b> attribute and will usually have a <b>method</b> and <b>id</b> attribute.</p>
  <ul>
  	<li><b>ACTION: </b></li>
  	<p>Every <b>form</b> element requires an <b>action</b> attribute. Its value is the URL for tha page on the server that will receive the infromation in the form when it is submitted.</p>
  	<li><b>METHOD: </b></li>
  	<p>Forms can be sent using one of two methods: <b>get</b> or <b>post</b></p>
  	<p>With the get <b>method</b>, the values from the form are added to the end of the URL specified in the <b>action</b> attribute.</p>
  	<p>The <b>get method</b> is ideal for: </p>
  	<ul>
  		<li>short forms (such as search boxes)</li>
  		<li>when you are just retrieving data from the web server (not sending information that should be added to or deleted from a database</li>
  	</ul>
  	<p>With the <b>post method</b> the values are sent in what are known as HTTP headers. As a rule of thumb you should use the <b>post method</b> if your form: </p>
  	<ul>
  		<li>allows users to upload a file</li>
  		<li>is very long</li>
  		<li>contains sensitive data (eg passwords)</li>
  		<li>adds infromation to, or deletes infromation from, a database</li>
  	</ul>
  	<p>If the <b>method</b> attribute is not used, the form data will be sent using <b>get method</b></p>
  	<li><b>ID: </b></li>
  	<p>The value of <b>(id)</b> is used to identify the form distinctly from other elements on the page (and is often used by scripts - such as those that check you have entered infromation into fields that require values)</p>
  	<li><b>SIZE: </b></li>
  	<p>The <b>size</b> attribute should not be used on new forms.</p>
  	<p>It was used in older forms to indicate the width of the text input (measured by the number of characters that would be seen).</p>
  	<p>For example, a value of 3 would create a box wide enough to display three characters (Although a user could eter more characters if they desired).</p>
  	<p>In any new forms you write CSS should be used to c ontrol the width of form elements.</p>
  	<p>The <b>size</b> attribute is only mentioned here because you may come across it when looking at older code.</p>
  </ul>

	<h4>Example: </h4>
	<form action="http://www.example.com/subscribe.php" method="get">
		<p>This is where the form controls will appear.</p>
	</form>
	<br>

	<h3>Text Input</h3>
  <ul>
  	<li><b>INPUT: </b></li>
  	<p>The <b>input</b> element is used to create several different form controls. The value of the <b>type</b> attribute determines what kind of input they will be creating.</p>
  	<li><b>TYPE="TEXT": </b></li>
  	<p>When the <b>type</b> attribute has a value of <b>text</b>, it creates a single-line text input</p>
  	<li><b>NAME: </b></li>
  	<p>When users enter information into a form, the server needs to know which form control each piece of data was entered into. (For example, in login form, the server needs to know what has been entered as the username and what has been given as the password).</p>
  	<p>Therefore, each form control requires a <b>name</b> attribute.</p>
  	<p>The value of this attribute identifies the form control and is sent along with the infromation they enter to the server.</p>
  	<li><b>MAXLENGTH: </b></li>
	<p>You can use the <b>maxlength</b> attribute to limit the number of characters a user may enter into the text field.</p>
	<p>Its value is the number of characters they may enter. For example, if you were asking for a year, the <b>maxlength</b> attribute could have a value of 4.</p>
  </ul>

  <h4>Example: </h4>
  <form action="http://www.example.com/login.php">
  	<p>Username:
  	<input type="text" name="username" size="15" maxlength="30" />
  	</p>
  </form>
  <br>

  <h3>Password Input</h3>
  <ul>
  	<li><b>TYPE="PASSWORD": </b></li>
  	<p>When the <b>type</b> attribute has a value of <b>password</b> it creates a text box that acts just like a single-line text input, except the characters are blocked out.</p>
  	<p>They are hidden in this way so that if someone is looking over the user's shoulder, they cannot see sensitive data such as passwords.</p>
  	<li><b>NAME: </b></li>
  	<p>The <b>name</b> attribute indicates the name of the password input, which is sent to the server with the password the user enters.</p>
  	<li><b>SIZE, MAXLENGTH: </b></li>
  	<p>It can also carry the <b>size</b> and <b>maxlength</b> attributes like the single-line text input.</p>
  	<p>Although the password is hidden on the screen, it does not mean that the data in password control is sent securely to the server. You should never use these for sending sensitive data such as credit card numbers.</p>
  	<p>For full security, the server needs to be set up to communicate with users' browsers using <b>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL</b>.</p>
  </ul>

  <h4>Example: </h4>
  <form action="http://www.example.com/login-php">
  	<p>Username:
  	<input type="text" name="username" size="15" maxlength="30" />
  	</p>
  	<p>Password:
  	<input type="password" name="passowrd" size="15" maxlength="30" />
  	</p>
  </form>

  <h3>Text Area</h3>
  <ul>
  	<li><b>TEXTAREA: </b></li>
  	<p>Is an element used to create multi-line text input.</p>
  	<p>Unlike other input elements this is not an empty element. It should therefore have an opening and closing tag.</p>
  	<p>Any text that appears between the opening <b>textarea</b> and closing <b>textarea</b> tags will appear in the text box when the page loads.</p>
  	<p>If the user does not delete any text between these tags, this message will get sent to the server along with whatever the user has typed. (Some sites use JavaScript to clear this information when the user clicks in the text area).</p>
  	<p>If you are creating a new form, you should use CSS to control the <b>width</b> and <b>height</b> of a <b>textarea</b>.</p>
  	<p>The <b>cols</b> attribute indicates how wide the text area should be (measured in numbers of characters). The rows attribute indicates how many rows the <b>text area</b> should take up vertically.</p>
  </ul>

  <h4>Example: </h4>
  <form action="http://www.example.com/comments.php">
  	<p>What did you think of this gig?</p>
  	<textarea name="comments" cols="20" rows="4">Enter your comments...</textarea>
  </form>

  <h3>Radio Button</h3>
  <ul>
  	<li><b>INPUT: </b></li>
  	<ul>
  		<li><b>TYPE="RADIO": </b></li>
  		<p>Radio buttons allow users to pick just one of a number of options.</p>
  		<li><b>NAME: </b></li>
  		<p>The <b>name</b> attribute is sent to the server with the value of the option the user selects.</p>
  		<p>When a question provides users with options for answers in the form of radio buttons, the value of the <b>name</b> attribute should be the same for all of the radio buttons used to answer that question.</p>
  		<li><b>VALUE: </b></li>
  		<p>The <b>value</b> attribute indicates the value that is sent to the server for the selected option.</p>
  		<p>The value of each of the buttons in a group should be different (so that the server knows which option the user has selected).</p>
  		<li><b>CHECKED: </b></li>
  		<p>The <b>checked</b> attribute can be used to indicate which value (if any) should be selected when the page loads.</p>
  		<p>The value of this attribute is <b>checked</b>. Only one radio button in a group should use this attribute.</p>
  		<p>Once a radio button has been selected it cannot be deselected. The user can only select a different option. If you are only allowing the user one option and want them to be able to deselect it (for example if they are indicating they agree to terms and conditions), you shoul use a checkbox instead.</p>
  	</ul>
  	<h4>Example: </h4>
  	<form action="http://www.example.com/profile.php">
  		<p>Please select your favourite genre: 
	  		<br />
	  		<input type="radio" name="genre" value="rock" checked="checked" />Rock
	  		<input type="radio" name="genre" value="pop" />Pop
	  		<input type="radio" name="genre" value="jazz" />Jazz
  		</p>
  	</form>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h3>Checkbox</h3>
  <ul>
  	<li><b>INPUT: </b></li>
  	<ul>
  		<li><b>TYPE="CHECKBOX": </b></li>
  		<p>Checkboxes allow users to select and deselect one or more options in answer to a question.</p>
  		<li><b>NAME: </b></li>
  		<p>The <b>name</b> attribute is sent to the server with the value of the option(s) the user selects. </p>
  		<p>When a question provides users with options for answers in the form of checkboxes, the value of the <b>name</b> attribute should be the same for all of the buttons that answer that question.</p>
  		<li><b>VALUE: </b></li>
  		<p>The <b>value</b> attribute indicates the value sent to the server if this checkbox is checked.</p>
  		<li><b>CHECKED: </b></li>
  		<p>The <b>checked</b> attribute indicates that this box should be checked when the page loads. If used, its value should be checked.</p>
  	</ul>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h3>Drop Down List Box</h3>
  <ul>
  	<li><b>SELECT:</b></li>
  	<p>A drop down list box, also known as a select box, allows users to select one option from a drop down list.</p>
  	<p>The <b>(select)</b> element is used to create a drop down list box. It contains two or more <b>(option)</b> elements.</p>
  	<ul>
  		<li><b>NAME: </b></li>
  		<p>The name attribute indicates the name of the form control being sent to the server, along with the value the user selected.</p>
  	</ul>
  	<li><b>OPTION: </b></li>
  	<p>The <b>(option)</b> element is used to specify the options that the user can select from. The words between opening <b>(option)</b> and closing <b>(option)</b> tags will be shown to the user in the drop down box.</p>
  	<ul>
	  	<li><b>VALUE: </b></li>
	  	<p>The <b>(option)</b> element uses the value attribute to indicate the value that is sent to the server along with the name of the control if this option is selected.</p>
	  	<li><b>SELECTED: </b></li>
	  	<p>The selected attribute can be used to indicate the option that should be selected when the page loads. The value of this attribute should be selected.</p>
	  	<p>If this attribute is not used, the first option will be shown when the page loads. If the user does not select an option, then the first item will be sent to the server as the value for this control.</p>
	</ul>	
	<p>The <b>function</b> of the drop down list box is similar to that of the radio buttons (in that only one option can be selected). There are two key factors in choosing which to use:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><p>If users need to see all options at a glance, radio buttons are better suited</p></li>
		<li><p>If there is a very long list of options (such as a list of countries), drop down list boxes work better</p></li>
	</ol>
	<h4>Example: </h4>
	<form action="http://www.example.com/profile.php">
		<p>What device do you listen to music on?</p>
		<select name="devices">
			<option value="ipod">iPod</option>
			<option value="radio">Radio</option>
			<option value="computer">Computer</option>
		</select>
	</form>
  </ul>
  <br>
	<h3>Multiple Select Box</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><b>SELECT: </b></li>
		<br>
		<ul>
		<li><b>SIZE: </b></li>
			<p>You can turn a drop down select box into a box that shows more than one option by adding the <b>size</b> attribute.</p>
			<p>Its value should be the number of options you want to show at once. In the example you can see that three of the four options are shown.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, the way that browsers have implemented this attribute is not perfect and it should be tested thoroughly if used (<em>in particular in Firefox and Safari on Mac</em>).</p>
			<li><b>MULTIPLE: </b></li>
			<p>You can allow users to select multiple options from this list by adding the <b>multiple</b> attribute with a value of multiple.</p>
			<p>It is a good idea to tell users if they can select more than one option at a time. It is also helpful to indicate that on a PC they should hold down the <b>control</b> key while selecting multiple options and on a Mac they should use the <b>command</b> key while selecting options.</p>
		</ul>
		<h4>Example: </h4>
		<form action="http://www.example.com/profile.php">
			<p>Do you play any of the following instruments? (You can select more than one option by holding down control on a PC or command key on a Mac while selecting different options.)</p>
			<select name="instruments" size="4" multiple="multiple">
				<option value="guitar" selected="selected">Guitar</option>
				<option value="drums">Drums</option>
				<option value="keyboard" selected="selected">Keyboard</option>
				<option value="bass">Bass</option>
			</select>
		</form>
	</ul>
	<h3>File Input Box</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><b>INPUT: </b></li>
		<p>If you want to allow users to upload a file (for example an image, video, mp3 or a PDF), you will need to use a file input box.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>TYPE="FILE": </b></li>
			<p>This type of input creates a box that looks like a text input followed by a <b><em>Browse</em></b> button. (One notable exception is Safari on a Mac, which tends to display a button labelled <b><em>Choose File</em></b> followed by the text "no file selected" or the name of the file that has been choseb by the user.)</p>
			<p>When the user clicks on the <b><em>Browse</em></b> button, a window opens up that allows them to sleect a file from their computer to be uploaded to the website.</p>
			<p>When you are allowing users to upload files, the <b>method</b> attribute on the <b>(form)</b> element must have a value of post (<em>You cannot send files using the HTTP get method</em>).</p>
			<p>When a user clicks on the <b>browse</b> button, the presentation of the window that allows them to browse for the file they want to upload will match the windows of the user's operating system. You cannot control the appearance of these windows.</p>
		</ul>
		<h4>Example: </h4>
		<form action="http://www.example.com/upload.php" method="post">
			<p>Upload your song in MP3 format: </p>
			<input type="file" name="user-song" /> <br />
			<input type="submit" value="Upload" />
		</form>
	</ul>
	<h3>Submit Button</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><b>INPUT: </b></li>
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li><b>TYPE="SUBMIT: </b></li>
			<p> Defines a button for submitting the form data to a form-handler. Or better say it is used to send a form to the server.</p>
			<p>The form-handler is typically a server page with a script for processing input data.</p>
			<p>The form-handler is specified in the form's action attribute: </p>
			<h4>Example: </h4>
			<form action="action_page.php">
			  First name:<br>
			  <input type="text" name="firstname" value="Mickey"><br>
			  Last name:<br>
			  <input type="text" name="lastname" value="Mouse"><br><br>
			  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
			</form><br>
			<li><b>NAME: </b></li>
			<p>It can use a name attribute but it does not need to have one</p>
			<li><b>VALUE: </b></li>
			<p>The <b>value</b> attribute is used to control the text that appears on a button. </p>
			<p>It is a good idea to specify the words you want to appear on a button because the default value of buttons on some browsers is <em>"Submit query"</em> and this might not be appropriate for all kinds of forms.</p>
			<p>Different browsers will shows submit buttons in different ways and tend to fit the visual presentation of the browser.</p>
			<p>If you want to control the appeareance of a submit button, you can either use CSS or you can use an image for the button.</p>
		</ul>
		<h4>Example: </h4>
		<form action="http://www.example.com/subscribe.php">
			<p>Subscribe to our email list:</p>
			<input type="text" name="email" />
			<input type="submit" name="subscribe" value="Subscribe" />
		</form>
	</ul>
	<h3>Image Button</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><b>INPUT: </b></li>
		<ul>
			<li><b>TYPE="IMAGE":</b></li>
			<p>If you want to use an image for the submit button, you can give the <b>type</b> attribute a value of <b>image</b>.</p>
			<p>The <b>src, width, height, alt</b> attributes work just like they do when used with the <b>img</b> element.</p>
		</ul>
		<h4>Example: </h4>
		<form action="http://www.example.org/subscribe.php">
			<p>Subscribe to our email list:</p>
			<input type="text" name="email" />
			<input type="image" src="images/subscribe.jpg" width="100" height="40">
		</form>
	</ul>
	<h3>Button and Hidden Controls</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><b>BUTTON: </b></li>
		<p>This element was introduced to allow users more control over how their buttons appear, and to allow other elements to appear inside the button.</p>
		<p>This means that you can combine text and images between the opening and closing <b>(button)</b> tags.</p>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li><b>INPUT: </b></li>
			<ul>
				<li><b>TYPE="HIDDEN": </b></li>
				<p>This example also shows a <b>hidden</b> form control. These form controls are not shown on the page (although you can see them if you use the <b><em>View Source</em></b> option in the browser).</p>
				<p>They allow web page authors to add values to forms that users cannot see.</p>
				<p>For example, a web page author might use a hidden field to indicate which page the user was on when they submitted a form.</p>
			</ul>
	</ul>
	<h4>Example: </h4>
	<form action="http://www.example.com/add.php">
		<button>
			<img src="images/add.gif" alt="add" width="20" height="20" /> Add
		</button>
		<input type="hidden" name="bookmark" value="lyrics" />
	</form>
	<h3>Labelling Form Controls</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><b>LABEL: </b></li>
		<p>When introducing <b>from controls</b>, the code was kept simple by indicating the purpose of each one in text next to it. However, each <b>from controls</b> should have its own <b>label</b> element as this makes the form accessible to vision-impaired users.</p>
		<p>The <b>(label)</b> element can be used in two ways. It can: </p>
		<ol>
			<li>Wrap around both the text description and the form input (as shown on the first line of the example).</li>
			<li>Be kept separate from the form control and use the <b>for</b> attribute to indicate which form control it is a label for (as shown with the radio buttons).</li>
		</ol>
		<ul><br>
			<li><b>FOR: </b></li>
			<p>The <b>for</b> attribute states which form control the label belongs to.</p>
			<p>Note how the radio buttons use the <b>id</b> attribute. The value of the <b>id</b> attribute uniquely identifies an element from all other elements on a page.</p>
			<p>The value of the <b>for</b> attribute mathes that of the <b>id</b> attribute on the form control it is labelling.</p>
			<p>This technique using the <b>for</b> and <b>id</b> attributes can be used on any form control.</p>
			<p>When a <b>(label)</b> element is used with a checkbox or radio button, users can click on either the form control or the label to select. </p>
			<p>The expanded clickable area makes the form easier to use. The position of the label is very important. If users do not know where to enter information or what information to enter, they are less likely to use the form correctly.</p>
			<p>As a rule of thumb, here are the best places to place labels on form controls.</p>
			<p><b>ABOVE OR TO THE LEFT:</b></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Text Inputs</li>
				<li>Text Areas</li>
				<li>Select Boxes</li>
				<li>File Uploads</li>
			</ul>
			<p><b>TO THE RIGHT:</b></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Individual Checkboxes</li>
				<li>Individual Radio Buttons</li>
			</ul>
		</ul><br>
		<h4>Example: </h4>
		<label>Age: <input type="text" name="age" /></label>
		<br />
		Gender:
		<input id="female" type="radio" name="gender" value="f">
		<label for="female">Female</label>
		<input id="male" type="radio" name="gender" value="m">
		<label for="male">Male</label>
	</ul>
	<h3>Grouping From Elements</h3>
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li><b>FIELDSET: </b></li>
		<p>You can group related form controls together inside the <b>fieldset</b> element. This is particularly helpful for longer forms.</p>
		<p>Most browsers will show the <b>fieldset</b> with a line around the edge to show how they are related. The appearance of these lines can be adjusted using CSS.</p>
		<li><b>LEGEND: </b></li>
		<p>The <b>legend</b> element can come directly after the opening <b>fieldset</b> tag and contains a caption which helps identify the purpose of that group of form controls.</p>
	</ul>	
	<h4>Example: </h4>
	<fieldset>
		<legend>Contact Details</legend>
		<label>Email:<br />
		<input type="text" name="email" /></label><br />
		<label>Mobile:<br />
		<input type="text" name="mobile" /></label><br />
		<label>Telephone:<br />
		<input type="text" name="telephone" /></label>
	</fieldset>
	<h3>Form Validation</h3>
	<p>You have probably seen forms on the web that give users messages if the form control has not been filed in correctly; this is known as <b>form validation</b></p>
	<p>Traditionally, form validation has been performed using JavaScript (which is beyond the scope of this book).</p>
	<p>But HTML5 is introducing <b>validation</b> and leaving the work to the browser.</p>
	<p>Validation helps ensure the user enters information in a form that the server will be able to understand when the form is submitted.</p>
	<p>Validating the contents of the form before it is sent to the server helps:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Reduce the amount of work the server has to do</li>
		<li>Enable users to see if there are problems with the form (faster than if validation were performed on the server)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>At the time of writing, only Chrome and Opera supported HTML5 validation, although other browsers are expected to follow.</p>
	<p>In order to support older browsers (that do not understand HTML5), web page autors are likely to continue using JavaScript to validate forms.</p>
	<p>An example, of HTML5 form validation is the <b>required</b> attribute, which can be used on any form element that the user is expected to fill in.</p>
	<p>This HTML5 attribute does not need a value, but in HTML4 all attributes must have a value. So, some people give this attribute a value of <b>required</b>.</p>
	<h4>Example: </h4>
	<form action="http://www.example.com/login/" method="post">
		<label for="username">Username: </label>
		<input type="text" name="username" required="required" /> <br />
		<label for="password">Password: </label>
		<input type="password" name="password" required="required" />
		<input type="submit" value="Submit" />
	</form>
	<br>
	<h3>Date Input</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><b>INPUT:</b></li>
		<p>Many forms need to gather information such as dates, email addresses and URLs. This has traditionally been done using text inputs.</p>
		<p>HTML5 introduces new form controls to standardise the way that some information is gathered. Older browsers that do not recognise these inputs will just treat them as a single line text box.</p>
		<li><b>TYPE="DATE": </b></li>
		<p>If you are asking the user for a date, you can use an <b>(input)</b> element and give the type attribute a value of date.</p>
		<p>This will create a date input in browsers that support the new HTML5 input types.</p>
		<p>This example shows what the date input looks like. The apperance of the date input changes across different browsers.</p>
	</ul>
	<form action="http://www.example.com/bookings/" method="post">
		<label for="depart">Departure date: </label>
		<input type="date" name="depart" />
		<input type="submit" value="Submit" />
	</form>
</ul>
