<h3>Linking To Other Sites</h3>
<p>Links are created using the (a) element which has an attribute called (href).</p>
<p>The value of the (href) attribute is the page that you want people to go to when they click on the link.</p>
<p>Users can click on anything that appears between the opening (a) tag and the closing (/a) tag and will be taken to the page specified in the href attribute.</p>
<p>When you link to a different website, the value of the (href) attribute will be the full web address for the site, which is known as an <b>absolute</b> URL.</p>

<p>Movie Reviews:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://empireonline.com">Empire</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://metacritic.com">Metacritic</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://rottentomatoes.com">Rotten Tomatoes</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://www.variety.com">Variety</a></li>
	</ul>

<p>URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. Every web page has its own URL. This is the web address that you would type into a browser if you wanted to visit that specific page.</p>
<p>An <b>absolute</b> URL starts with the domain name for that site and can be followed by the path to a specific page. If no page is specified, the site will display the homepage.</p>

<h3>Linking To Other Pages On The Same Site</h3>

	<ul>
		<li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
		<li><a href="about.html">About</a></li>
		<li><a href="movies.html">Movies</a></li>

<p>When yo uare linking to other pages within the same site, you do not need to specify the domain name in the URL. You can use a shorthand known as a <b>relative</b> URL.</p>
<p>If all the pages of the site are in the same folder, then the value of the (href) attribute is just the name of the file.</p>
<p>If you have different pages of a site in different folders, then you can use a slightly more comples syntax to indicate where the page is in relation to the current page.</p>

<h4>Relative URLs</h4>
<p>When linking to other pages within the same site, you can use relative URLs. These are like a shorthand version of absolute URLs because you do not need to specify the domain name.</p>
<p>Relative URLs help when building a site on your computer because you can create links between pages without having to set up your domain name or hosting.</p>
