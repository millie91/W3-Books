<h3>Linking To Other Sites</h3>
<p>Links are created using the (a) element which has an attribute called (href).</p>
<p>The value of the (href) attribute is the page that you want people to go to when they click on the link.</p>
<p>Users can click on anything that appears between the opening (a) tag and the closing (/a) tag and will be taken to the page specified in the href attribute.</p>
<p>When you link to a different website, the value of the (href) attribute will be the full web address for the site, which is known as an <b>absolute</b> URL.</p>

<br>

<p>Movie Reviews:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://empireonline.com">Empire</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://metacritic.com">Metacritic</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://rottentomatoes.com">Rotten Tomatoes</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://www.variety.com">Variety</a></li>
	</ul>

<p>URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. Every web page has its own URL. This is the web address that you would type into a browser if you wanted to visit that specific page.</p>
<p>An <b>absolute</b> URL starts with the domain name for that site and can be followed by the path to a specific page. If no page is specified, the site will display the homepage.</p>

<h3>Linking To Other Pages On The Same Site</h3>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
		<li><a href="about.html">About</a></li>
		<li><a href="movies.html">Movies</a></li>
		<li><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>When yo uare linking to other pages within the same site, you do not need to specify the domain name in the URL. You can use a shorthand known as a <b>relative</b> URL.</p>
<p>If all the pages of the site are in the same folder, then the value of the (href) attribute is just the name of the file.</p>
<p>If you have different pages of a site in different folders, then you can use a slightly more comples syntax to indicate where the page is in relation to the current page.</p>

<h4>Relative URLs</h4>
<p>When linking to other pages within the same site, you can use relative URLs. These are like a shorthand version of absolute URLs because you do not need to specify the domain name.</p>
<p>Relative URLs help when building a site on your computer because you can create links between pages without having to set up your domain name or hosting.</p>

<h3>Email Links</h3>
<ul>
<li>To create a link that starts up the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified email address, you use the (a) element.</li>
<li>However, this time the value of the (href) attribute starts with mailto: and is followed by the email address you want the email to be sent to.</li>
<li>On the right you can see that an email link looks just like any other link, but when it is clicked on, the user's email program will open a new email message and address it to the person specified in the link.</li>	
</ul>

<h5>Example: </h5>
<a href="mailto:milicasucevic@gmail.com">Email Milica</a>

<h3>Opening Links In A New Window</h3>
<p>If you want a link to open in a new window, you can use the target attribute on the opening (a) tag. The value of this attribute should be <b>_blank</b>.</p>
<p>One of the most common reasons a web page author might want a link to be opened in a new window is if it points to another website.</p>
<p>In such cases, they hope the user will return to the window containing their site after finishing looking at the other one.</p>

<h3>Linking To A Specific Part Of The Same Page</h3>
<p>At the top of a long page you might want to add a list of contents that links to the corresponding sections lower down. Or you want to add a link from part way down the page back to the top of it to save users from having to scroll back to the top.</p>
<p>Before you can link to a specific part of a page, you need to identify the points in the page that the link will go to. You do this using the <b>id</b> attribute (which can be used on every HTML element). You can see that the (h1) and (h2) elements in this example have been given <b>id</b> attributes that identify those sections of the page.</p>
<p>The value of the (id) attribute should start with a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character) and, on a single page, no two (id) attributes should have the same value.</p>

<h1 id="top" align="center">Film-Making Terms</h1>
<a href="#arc_shot">Arc Shot</a><br>
<a href="#interlude">Interlude</a><br>
<a href="#prologue">Prologue</a><br><br>
<h2 id="arc_shot">Arc Shot</h2>
<p>A shot in which the subject is photographed by an encircling or moving camera</p>
<h2 id="interlude">Interlude</h2>
<p>A brief, intervening film scene or sequence, not specifically tied to the plot, that appears within a film</p>
<h2 id="prologue">Prologue</h2>
<p>A speech, preface, introduction, or brief scene preceding the main action or plot of a film; contract to epilogue</p>
<p><a href="#top">Top</a></p>

<p>To link an element that uses an (id) attribute you use the (a) element again, but the value of the (href) attribute starts with the #symbol, followed by the value of the (id) attribute of the element you want to link to. In this example (a href="#top") links to the (h1) element at the top of the page whose (id) attribute has a value of top.</p>

<h3>Linking To A Specific Part Of Another Page</h3>
<p>If you want to link to a specific part of a different page (whether on your own site or a different website) you can use a similar technique.</p>
<p>As long as the page you are linking to has (id) attributes that identify specific parts of the page, you can simply add the same syntax to the end of the link for that page.</p>
<p>Therefore, the (href) attribute will contain the address for the page (either an absolute URL or a relative URL), followed by the #symbol, followed by the value of the (id) attribute that is used on the element you are linking to.</p>
<p>For example, to link to the bottom of the homepage of the website that accompanies this book, you would write: </p>
<a href="http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/#bottom">Click here to see Example</a>
